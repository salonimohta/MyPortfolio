      <p>Hello there!
         I am Saloni Mohta, a final year undergraduate at IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.<br/>
         I have been a Computer Science enthusiast right from my high school.<br/>
         Making an impact on someone's life through my work is what drives me to code.<br/>
         I have interned at Microsoft twice, and impacting lives through my work, is what I learnt from their culture!<br/>
         Apart from projects, I have a keen interest in sport programming as well!
        </p>
        <p>
        Well, I am tech savvy and always look forward to learn technologies that interests me,<br/>
        but I also like to travel alot, as you can see in some pictures in my gallery!
        I intend to do a world tour in the future too!
        I am not very good at activities other than technology, but there has been first times for me, when I entered my college that is IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.<br/>
        Some of which has been depicted in my gallery too, like performing in front of a large audience, painting a canvas, growing a plant, overcoming my fear of dogs!<br/>
        I have been a part of a technical society in my college called CyberLabs, where we build products for our college and also boost our understanding about new tech.<br/>
        In my freshman year, I was a part of the basketball team as well, which went for the inter-IIT tournament to IIT Madras.<br/>
        In my sophomore year, I interned at Microsoft as a part of the Codess Program, and I was extended the offer for a return internship in Microsoft in my pre-final year as well.<br/>
        I also got a chance to explore the Google office in Hyderabad, and Uber office in Bangalore as a part of an event in both the companies.
